\title{Bootstrap the null distribution for a statistic centered at a given value}
\usage{
boot_centered_null(dat, statistic, center, ..., reps = 10000)
}
\description{
This function generates a distribution for the null hypothesis that two
groups do not differ in some statistic. For example if we were interested in
whether two samples had a different mean; this function would produce a
bootstrapped sample for one group centered at the actual mean across both
groups. This ensures that the bootstrapped distribution corresponds to the
actual null hypothesis. Explained better here:
